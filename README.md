How to speed up and improve mixed methods research by incorporating ChatGPT as a mentor and reasoning engine

Since March 2023 I have intensively experimented with ChatGPT Plus and finished my first ever NLP project incorporating the chatbot. I also looked into GitHub Codex, the OpenAI API, and LangChain prompting. I am now eagerly awaiting the announced Microsoft OneNote Copilot.  MaxQDA AI assist

Before moving on to my next project I have reflected on how openAI's language models might shape NLP and mixed methods research in the near future. Having a degree in social science with an emphasis on qualitative research and mixed methods I assume that the latter two wil move very closely together with machine learning especially NLP. This is because setting up resepective tools has become a lot easier through the help of ChatGPT and will most likely become even easier once GPT has been incorporatd into 

I am hoping that advanced NLP text manipulations will soon be possible without the need to run code within an IDE. Extracting meaning and information from text would become a lot more manageable this way.  

In the link below I have created a flow chart of the steps of mixed methods research including NLP analysis. The process depicted in this flow chart is still very exhaustive. When following these steps supported by GPT they become muchmor eefficent and manageable. THere is also more teim efor
